An example package with both python code and an extension module.  This package
exists because it took me a day to get it to work and I don't want to forget it.
If it helps anybody else, more the better.

Notes:
1. The cythoning is not done during install; this is considered bad form, as it
requires the user to have cython installed, instead of simply a compiler.

2. It is considered good practice to include both the .c and .pyx file, as
that allows modification and recompilation (via cython), if so desired.

3. I have set things up to place the extension modules inside the main package;
I'm not sure if I've done this the best way, but it seems to work.
